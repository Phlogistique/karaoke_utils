Miscelaneous karaoke utils
==========================

This repo contains serveral utils that manipulate subtitle files used to
display karaoke. Most are useless/outdated/dirty hacks, but some of them may be
useful.

Some of them only work with Ruby 1.9, some others only work with Ruby 1.8.

ass2frm.rb
        Generates .frm and .lyr files suitable for use with toyunda-gen.rb from
        an ASS file with \k or \kf commands before each syllabe. Tries to
        imitate the effect of a continuous cursor if there are \kf tags.

continuous.rb
        A plugin to use with toyunda-gen.rb to imitate the effect of a
        continuously running cursor, like a real karaoke or \kf in ASS.

gen2ass.rb
        Generates an ASS file from the source files for toyunda-gen.rb, or from
        a file generated by toyunda-gen.rb.

properties.rb
        Gets the resolution and the framerate of a video file using mplayer.

hardsub.rb
compile.rb
upload.rb
        Nothing really useful.
        Those scripts are just hacky proto-makefiles I used to upload a lot of
        hardsubbed karaoke videos to Youtube. Then Youtube deleted my account.
        They depend on mplayer-toyunda-lol that for some reason doesn't work
        anymore.

missing.rb
utils.rb
        Useless, why are those even here.
