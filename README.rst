Miscelaneous karaoke utils
==========================

This repo contains serveral utils that manipulate subtitle files used to
display karaoke. Most are useless/outdated/dirty hacks, but some of them may be
useful. The "Toyunda" is a software suite used by French student association
Epitanime for displaying karaokes during the events they organize.

Some of them only work with Ruby 1.9, some others only work with Ruby 1.8.

ass2frm.rb
        Generates .frm and .lyr files suitable for use with toyunda-gen.rb from
        an ASS file with \k or \kf commands before each syllabe. Tries to
        imitate the effect of a continuous cursor if there are \kf tags.

continuous.rb
        A plugin to use with toyunda-gen.rb to imitate the effect of a
        continuously running cursor, like a real karaoke or \kf in ASS.

gen2ass.rb
        Generates an ASS file from the source files for toyunda-gen.rb, or from
        a file generated by toyunda-gen.rb.

properties.rb
        Gets the resolution and the framerate of a video file using mplayer.

webi/
        A quick web interface to some of these tools using the Ruby web
        framework Ramaze. Not super secure, run at your own discretion.

mplayer-toyunda-lol/
        Converts from an arbitrary Toyunda karaoke file to an ASS file; one
        subtitle line is generated for every subtitle character, so the
        resulting file is quite big. It worked at some point but now it
        doesn't.

        The name is because it was intended to be usable as a drop-in
        replacement from mplayer-toyunda by providing a wrapper that compiled
        Toyunda files to ASS before launching a vanilla mplayer. The main goal
        was proving that using ASS for the needs adressed by the Toyunda is
        completely feasible. I think the "lol" was intended as sarcasm with
        regards to the "not invented here" syndrome and the general arrogance
        of the Epitanime staff in the recent years.

hardsub.rb compile.rb upload.rb
        Nothing really useful.
        Those scripts are just hacky proto-makefiles I used to upload a lot of
        hardsubbed karaoke videos to Youtube. Then Youtube deleted my account.
        They depend on mplayer-toyunda-lol that for some reason doesn't work
        anymore.

missing.rb utils.rb
        Useless, why are those even here.
